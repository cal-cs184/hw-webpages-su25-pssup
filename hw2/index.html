		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		<p>A Bezier curve is a polynomial curve that represents a parameter through control points. One way to implement this is through the de Casteljau subdivision. Given control points \(\mathbf{p}_{1}\) to \(\mathbf{p}_{n}\) and the parameter \(t\), one step of the algorithm computes new points \(\mathbf{p}'_{1}\) to \(\mathbf{p}'_{n-1}\) as follows:</p>

		\[
		\mathbf{p}'_{i} = (1-t) \mathbf{p}_{i} + t \mathbf{p}_{i+1}
		\]

		<p>By repeating this process until only one point remains, we will finally obtain the point on the polynomial curve for parameter \(t\) as follows:</p>

		\[
		\mathbf{f}(t; \mathbf{p}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{p}_{n}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\pmatrix{n-1\\i-1} (1-t)^{n-i} t^{i-1} \mathbf{p}_{i}}
		\]

		<p>Below is an example of a Bezier curve with six control points.</p>

		<p>The point at the center of the curve (\(t=0.5\)) is evaluated in these steps:</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		<p>A Bezier surface is an application of the principle of Bezier curve extended to 2D. For the 2D grid of the control points \((\mathbf{p}_{11}, \dots, \mathbf{p}_{1n}), \dots, (\mathbf{p}_{n1}, \dots, \mathbf{p}_{nn}) \), a point \(\mathbf{r}\) on the Bezier surface at the parameters \((u, v)\) is calculated in this way:</p>

		\[
		\mathbf{q}_{k} = \mathbf{f}(u; \mathbf{p}_{k1}, \dots, \mathbf{p}_{kn}) \quad \textrm{for } 1 \leq k \leq n \\
		\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{f}(v; \mathbf{q}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{q}_{n})
		\]

		<p>where \(\mathbf{f}\) is the function for Bezier curves in Part 1, and it is implemented via the 1D de Casteljau algorithm.</p>

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		<p>One way to smoothly shade a triangle mesh is to compute a normal vector for each vertex of the mesh. The area-weighted normal method implements calculating the normal vector for the vertex in this way: For each vertex \(v\), the normal vector at \(v\) can be obtained by adding the normal vectors \(\mathbf{N}_i\) of the faces adjacent to \(v\) and normalizing the result. This is conceptually the same as taking the unit normal vector \(\mathbf{\hat{N}}_i\) for each face and multiplying its area \(A_i\) as the weight.</p>

		\[
		\mathbf{\hat{N}}_v = \frac{\sum_{i}{\mathbf{N}_i}}{\| \sum_{i}{\mathbf{N}_i} \|} = \frac{\sum_{i}{A_i \mathbf{\hat{N}}_i}}{\| \sum_{i}{A_i \mathbf{\hat{N}}_i} \|}
		\]

		<p>The normal vector \(\mathbf{N}_i\) of each face can be calculated for using the coordinates \(\mathbf{p}_{i1}, \mathbf{p}_{i2}, \mathbf{p}_{i3}\) of the three vertices of the face:</p>

		\[
		\mathbf{N}_i = (\mathbf{p}_{i2} - \mathbf{p}_{i1}) \times (\mathbf{p}_{i3} - \mathbf{p}_{i1}) = A_i \mathbf{\hat{N}}_i
		\]

		<p>The following images show the difference in rendering without vertex normals and with them.</p>

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		<p>Edge flip is the process of transforming the topology of a mesh \(abdc\) by reconnecting edge \(bc\) to vertices \(a\) and \(d\), as shown in the following diagram.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="img/edgeflip.jpg" width="400px"/>
			<figcaption>Diagram for the edge flip and the mesh. <span style="font-size: 50%">Source: <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su25/hw/hw2/section2/">https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su25/hw/hw2/section2/</a></span></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>As the topological transformation of the mesh occurs, the relationships between the vertices and the faces are changed: The face \(abc\) is rearranged to \(adc\), and face \(cbd\) to \(abd\). The half-edges within the face are also rearranged accordingly. The following diagram shows this change.</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="img/edgeflip_diagram.png" width="400px"/>
			<figcaption>Diagram showing affected half-edges and faces. <span style="font-size: 50%">(Modified from the above image)</span></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>Here are the things I did in my implementation:
			<ul>
				<li>Reassigned half-edges for each face, edge, and vertex in the mesh. I took the minimal approach of not touching elements that referenced the elements outside the target mesh.</li>
				<li>Assigned twin, next, vertex, edge, and face for each of the 6 half-edges in the mesh. Also reassigned twins for the 4 related half-edges outside the mesh.</li>
				<li>I have it set to ignore requests if the flipping edge is on a boundary, or if either of the two adjacent faces is on a boundary.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>During the development, I initially considered about twin, next, vertex, edge, face only for the 6 half-edges in the mesh, but I did not consider about setting new twins for the 4 half-edges outside the mesh that has twin relationships with the inside half-edges. As a result, the screen froze when I clicked on a vertex in inspection after an edge flip. To solve this, I traversed the half-edges around the vertex and investigated the addresses, and found out that the half-edges outside of the target mesh of the edge flip were not set properly. This allowed me to fix the bug.</p>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/split.jpg" width="400px"/>
			<figcaption>Diagram for the edge split and the mesh. <span style="font-size: 50%">Source: <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su25/hw/hw2/section2/">https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su25/hw/hw2/section2/</a></span></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>In the edge splitting task, I added the following new elements:
			<ul>
				<li>Faces: <code>f_2</code> (\(dcm\)), <code>f_3</code> (\(cam\)). The original faces <code>f_0</code> (\(abc\)) and <code>f_1</code> (\(bdc\)) were reallocated as the faces \(abm\) and \(bdm\) respectively.</li>
				<li>Edges: <code>e_ma</code>, <code>e_md</code>, <code>e_mc</code>. The original edge <code>e0</code> was reallocated as the edge \(mb\). </li>
				<li>Vertices: <code>v_m</code> (\(m\))</li>
				<li>Half-edges: <code>h_ma</code>, <code>h_mc</code>, <code>h_md</code>, <code>h_am</code>, <code>h_cm</code>, <code>h_dm</code>. The half-edge <code>h_0</code> and its twin <code>h_3</code>, originally pointing from \(b\) to \(c\) and from \(c\) to \(b\) respectively, were reallocated to point from \(b\) to \(m\) and from \(m\) to \(b\), respectively.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<figure>
			<img src="img/split_diagram.png" width="400px"/>
			<figcaption>Diagram showing affected half-edges, faces and edges. <span style="font-size: 50%">(Modified from the above image)</span></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>I updated the pointers for everything that changed. Unlike Part 4, I didn't reallocate the half-edges that had twins outside of mesh \(abdc\), I just left them where they were. (But I did update the ones that changed, like <code>next()</code>.) And as in Part 4, I have it set to ignore the request for the boundary mesh.</p>

		<p>Also, to distinguish between edges that were cut in half from the original edge (\(bm\) and \(cm\)) and completely newly created edges (\(ma\) and \(md\)), I have assigned to the former a half-edge coming into the center vertex \(m\), and to the latter a half-edge going out of \(m\). This will be important in Part 6.</p>

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		<p>I implemented the loop subdivision in these steps:
			<ol>
				<li>For the old vertices, compute the new positions using the Loop subdivision rule. <i>Note that it should be performed as a batch, not immediately; the actual updating process happens in step 5.</i></li>
				<li>Compute the positions of the newly added vertices, which are the midpoints of the old edges.</li>
				<li>Split edge for all old edges, and mark the newly created elements as new.</li>
				<li>Flip edge for all new edges whose related half-edge is pointing from an new vertex to an old vertex. <i>What I did in Part 5 is to help distinguishing between edges that were created by splitting old edges (which should not be flipped) and edges that were added entirely new (which should be flipped).</i></li>
				<li>Update the final vertex positions.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
